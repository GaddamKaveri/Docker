Docker:

Docker is a popular platform that simplifies the process of creating, deploying, and managing applications by using containerization.

What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that uses containerization technology to allow developers to package applications and their dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. Containers are lightweight, portable, and ensure consistency across different environments.

Key Concepts

Image: A Docker image is a read-only template used to create containers. It contains the application code, libraries, and dependencies required for the application to run. Images are built from a set of instructions written in a Dockerfile.

Container: A container is a running instance of a Docker image. It is an isolated environment that includes everything needed to run an application. Containers share the host system's kernel but run in their isolated user space.

Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image. It includes commands for installing software, copying files, setting environment variables, and specifying the entry point for the application.

Docker Hub: Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service where you can find and share Docker images. It allows you to pull pre-built images or push your images for others to use.

Basic Docker Commands:

docker run: Create and start a container from an image.

docker build: Build an image from a Dockerfile.

docker pull: Download an image from a registry.

docker push: Upload an image to a registry.

docker ps: List running containers.

docker stop: Stop a running container.

docker rm: Remove a container.

docker rmi: Remove an image.

Benefits of Docker :

Consistency: Docker containers ensure that software will always run the same, regardless of where it's deployed.

Isolation: Each container runs in isolation, allowing you to run multiple containers simultaneously without conflicts.

Portability: Containers can run on any system that supports Docker, making it easy to move applications between environments.

Scalability: Docker makes it easy to scale applications horizontally by adding more container instances.
